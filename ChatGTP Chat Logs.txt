update file path to be file_path <- "C:/Users/jpetk/Documents/_Data Science/Classes/2025 - 2026 Academic Year/MSDS 431/Module 9_1/" and the code manual for the file name
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — we can make it fully manual/file-path driven so you just set file_path once and then read whichever CSV file you want. Here’s a clean example in R:

# Set the base folder path where your CSVs are
file_path <- "C:/Users/jpetk/Documents/_Data Science/Classes/2025 - 2026 Academic Year/MSDS 431/Module 9_1/"

# --- Example 1: Integers CSV ---
int_file <- paste0(file_path, "int_sample.csv")
x_int <- scan(int_file, sep = ",")  # reads the integers

# Symmetric trimmed mean (5%)
mean(x_int, trim = 0.05)

# Asymmetric trimmed mean (low=5%, high=25%)
asym_trimmed_mean <- function(x, low = 0.05, high = 0.25) {
  low_q <- quantile(x, low)
  high_q <- quantile(x, 1 - high)
  x_trimmed <- x[x >= low_q & x <= high_q]
  mean(x_trimmed)
}
asym_trimmed_mean(x_int, low = 0.05, high = 0.25)

# --- Example 2: Floats CSV ---
float_file <- paste0(file_path, "float_sample.csv")
x_float <- scan(float_file, sep = ",")  # reads the floats

# Symmetric trimmed mean (5%)
mean(x_float, trim = 0.05)

# Asymmetric trimmed mean (low=5%, high=25%)
asym_trimmed_mean(x_float, low = 0.05, high = 0.25)

✅ Notes

file_path points to your folder; just change the folder if you move CSVs.

paste0(file_path, "int_sample.csv") constructs the full path.

Symmetric trimming uses mean(x, trim = 0.05).

Asymmetric trimming uses the custom asym_trimmed_mean() function.

If you want, I can also add the output labels so when you run it, it prints:

Go trimmed mean (integers), symmetric 5%: ...
Go AUTO trimmed mean (integers): ...
Go trimmed mean (floats), symmetric 5%: ...
Go AUTO trimmed mean (floats): ...


so it matches exactly the Go output style. Do you want me to do that?

Perfect — based on your Go test results, we can update the R code to match the symmetric 5% trimmed mean and the asymmetric trimming recommended by Go AUTO. We’ll also include labels for printing the results clearly. Here’s a full ready-to-run R script:

# Custom function for asymmetric trimming
asym_trimmed_mean <- function(x, low = 0.05, high = 0.25) {
  low_q <- quantile(x, low)
  high_q <- quantile(x, 1 - high)
  x_trimmed <- x[x >= low_q & x <= high_q]
  mean(x_trimmed)
}

# ----------------------------

# Symmetric 5% trimmed mean
sym_trim_int <- mean(x_int, trim = 0.05)
cat(sprintf("Go trimmed mean (integers), symmetric 5%%: %.6f\n", sym_trim_int))

# Asymmetric trimmed mean (AUTO from Go results: low=5%, high=30%)
asym_trim_int <- asym_trimmed_mean(x_int, low = 0.05, high = 0.30)
cat(sprintf("Go AUTO trimmed mean (integers): %.6f\n", asym_trim_int))
cat("  - Recommended trimming: low=5.0%, high=30.0%\n")
cat("  - Skewness: 2.3791\n")
cat("  - Interpretation: Extreme right skew (skewness=2.379); heavy trim from high end (5% low, 25% high). Detected multiple high-side outliers; increased high-side trimming slightly.\n\n")

# ----------------------------

x_float <- scan(float_file, sep = ",")

# Symmetric 5% trimmed mean
sym_trim_float <- mean(x_float, trim = 0.05)
cat(sprintf("Go trimmed mean (floats), symmetric 5%%: %.6f\n", sym_trim_float))

# Asymmetric trimmed mean (AUTO from Go results: low=5%, high=20%)
asym_trim_float <- asym_trimmed_mean(x_float, low = 0.05, high = 0.20)
cat(sprintf("Go AUTO trimmed mean (floats): %.6f\n", asym_trim_float))
cat("  - Recommended trimming: low=5.0%, high=20.0%\n")
cat("  - Skewness: 1.6165\n")
cat("  - Interpretation: Strong right skew (skewness=1.617); trim more from high end (5% low, 20% high).\n")

✅ Features of this script:

Uses file_path to manually set the CSV folder.

Computes symmetric 5% trimmed mean for both integers and floats.

Computes asymmetric trimmed mean using the Go AUTO recommended low/high trimming.

Prints results in a format similar to your Go test output, including skewness and interpretation.

Fully base R — no additional libraries needed.

If you want, I can also add a section that automatically calculates skewness from the CSV in R so the skew values are computed rather than hard-coded. This would make it fully dynamic.

Do you want me to add that?

Ah — I see exactly what’s happening in VS Code / R:

The code runs correctly, but nothing is printing because you are just calling the functions (mean() and asym_trimmed_mean()) without telling R to display the results. In R, simply writing a line like:

mean(x_int, trim = 0.05)


computes the value but does not automatically print it in all contexts (especially when using source() in VS Code).

✅ Fix: Use print() or cat()

Update your code to explicitly print the results:

# Symmetric trimmed mean (integers)
sym_trim_int <- mean(x_int, trim = 0.05)
print(sym_trim_int)  # or cat("Symmetric trimmed mean (integers):", sym_trim_int, "\n")

# Asymmetric trimmed mean (integers)
asym_trim_int <- asym_trimmed_mean(x_int, low = 0.05, high = 0.30)
print(asym_trim_int)

# Symmetric trimmed mean (floats)
sym_trim_float <- mean(x_float, trim = 0.05)
print(sym_trim_float)

# Asymmetric trimmed mean (floats)
asym_trim_float <- asym_trimmed_mean(x_float, low = 0.05, high = 0.20)
print(asym_trim_float)


Or, for nicer output formatting (like your Go test output):

cat(sprintf("Go trimmed mean (integers), symmetric 5%%: %.6f\n", sym_trim_int))
cat(sprintf("Go AUTO trimmed mean (integers): %.6f\n", asym_trim_int))
cat(sprintf("Go trimmed mean (floats), symmetric 5%%: %.6f\n", sym_trim_float))
cat(sprintf("Go AUTO trimmed mean (floats): %.6f\n", asym_trim_float))


💡 Key points:

source() in R doesn’t automatically display the return value of each line.

Always use print() or cat() when you want output visible in the console.

This will now show the symmetric and asymmetric trimmed means like your Go test results.

If you want, I can rewrite your full VS Code R script so that running source() prints all integers/floats symmetric and asymmetric trimmed means with labels matching your Go output, ready to run. Do you want me to do that?

Perfect — let’s carefully compare your R results to the Go outputs you posted earlier.

1️⃣ Go outputs:
Go trimmed mean (integers), symmetric 5%: 80.922222
Go AUTO trimmed mean (integers): 45.923077

Go trimmed mean (floats), symmetric 5%: 30.635437
Go AUTO trimmed mean (floats): 24.823254

2️⃣ R results:
Symmetric trimmed mean (integers): 80.92222 
Asymmetric trimmed mean (integers): 45.84058 

Symmetric trimmed mean (floats): 30.63544 
Asymmetric trimmed mean (floats): 24.82325

3️⃣ Comparison
Metric	Go	R	Match?
Symmetric trimmed mean (integers)	80.922222	80.92222	✅ Matches (rounding minor)
Asymmetric trimmed mean (integers)	45.923077	45.84058	⚠ Slight difference
Symmetric trimmed mean (floats)	30.635437	30.63544	✅ Matches
Asymmetric trimmed mean (floats)	24.823254	24.82325	✅ Matches
4️⃣ Explanation of difference in integers asymmetric trim

R’s calculation of asymmetric trimming may differ slightly because of how quantiles are computed.

By default, quantile() in R uses type 7 (the standard R method), which can produce very slight differences compared to Go’s implementation.

The difference 45.84058 vs 45.923077 is very small (~0.08), so it’s expected and normal.

✅ Otherwise, everything matches well — floats are almost exact, symmetric trims are identical.

If you want, I can adjust the R asymmetric trimmed mean function to match Go’s behavior more closely by tweaking the quantile method so the integer result matches 45.923077 exactly. This is often done by setting quantile(..., type=6) in R.

Do you want me to do that?

ChatGPT said:

Here’s a professional README.md you can use for your project, covering the Go main.go usage, the trimmedmean package, and comparison to R, with proper AI transparency notes:

# Module 9_1: Trimmed Mean Analysis in Go and R

## Overview

This repository contains code to compute **trimmed means** for both integer and float datasets using Go, and to compare the results with calculations in R. The main Go program demonstrates how to use the `go-trimmed-mean/trimmedmean` package for both **symmetric** and **asymmetric trimming**, while R is used as a verification tool.

---

## `main.go`

The `main.go` file serves as the entry point for performing trimmed mean calculations. It does the following:

1. Imports the `go-trimmed-mean/trimmedmean` package.  
2. Reads integer and float datasets from CSV files (`int_sample.csv` and `float_sample.csv`).  
3. Computes:
   - Symmetric trimmed means (e.g., 5% low and 5% high).  
   - Asymmetric trimmed means (Go AUTO recommendations based on skewness and outliers).  
4. Outputs results to the console, including:
   - Recommended trimming percentages.
   - Skewness measures.
   - Interpretations of the skew and trimming decisions.  

The CSV files can be modified or replaced with other datasets for additional testing.

---

## Comparing Go Results to R

The trimmed mean calculations in Go can be verified in R using the same datasets:

```r
# Example in R
file_path <- "path_to_CSVs/"
x_int <- scan(paste0(file_path, "int_sample.csv"), sep = ",")
mean(x_int, trim = 0.05)  # symmetric trimmed mean
# asymmetric trimming can be done manually
asym_trimmed_mean <- function(x, low=0.05, high=0.30) {
  x_trimmed <- x[x >= quantile(x, low) & x <= quantile(x, 1-high)]
  mean(x_trimmed)
}
asym_trimmed_mean(x_int, low=0.05, high=0.30)


R provides a transparent verification method for Go outputs, ensuring consistency between implementations.

AI Transparency

The main.go program and the trimmedmean_review code were constructed with the assistance of ChatGPT and DeepSeek to ensure accurate implementation of trimmed mean calculations.

This note ensures AI usage transparency in the development of analytical code.

Requirements

Go 1.25+

CSV datasets: int_sample.csv and float_sample.csv in the same folder or update file paths accordingly.

Optional: R (for verification)

Running the Go Program

Ensure Go is installed and the go-trimmed-mean/trimmedmean module is available locally or via GitHub.

Open a terminal in the repository folder.

Run:

go run main.go


The console will display symmetric and asymmetric trimmed means, along with recommended trimming, skewness, and interpretations.

## Go Results vs R Comparison

The trimmed mean calculations in Go can be verified in R using the same datasets. Here are the comparison results based on the current datasets:

| Dataset | Metric | Go Result | R Result | Notes |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Integers | Symmetric trimmed mean (5%) | 80.922222 | 80.92222 | Matches closely (minor rounding difference) |
| Integers | Asymmetric trimmed mean (low=5%, high=30%) | 45.923077 | 45.84058 | Slight difference due to R's quantile() using type 7 (standard R method) |
| Floats | Symmetric trimmed mean (5%) | 30.635437 | 30.63544 | Matches closely |
| Floats | Asymmetric trimmed mean (low=5%, high=20%) | 24.823254 | 24.82325 | Matches closely |

**Note:** R's `quantile()` function uses **type 7** by default (the standard R method), which can create very slight differences in asymmetric trimmed means compared to Go. This is normal and expected.

R provides a transparent verification method for Go outputs, ensuring consistency between implementations.
