# Module 9_1: Trimmed Mean Analysis in Go and R

## Overview

This repository contains code to compute **trimmed means** for both integer and float datasets using Go, and to compare the results with calculations in R. The main Go program demonstrates how to use the `go-trimmed-mean/trimmedmean` package for both **symmetric** and **asymmetric trimming**, while R is used as a verification tool.

## `main.go`

The `main.go` file serves as the entry point for performing trimmed mean calculations. It does the following:

1. Imports the `go-trimmed-mean/trimmedmean` package.  
2. Reads integer and float datasets from CSV files (`int_sample.csv` and `float_sample.csv`) that is randomly generated by the `main.go` file.  
3. Computes:
   - Symmetric trimmed means (e.g., 5% low and 5% high).  
   - Asymmetric trimmed means (Go AUTO recommendations based on skewness and outliers).  
4. Outputs results to the console, including:
   - Recommended trimming percentages.
   - Skewness measures.
   - Interpretations of the skew and trimming decisions.  

The CSV files can be modified or replaced with other datasets for additional testing. Removal of the random int and float dataset generates in the main.go function would need to be removed for this.

## Go Results vs R Comparison

The trimmed mean calculations in Go can be verified in R using the same datasets. Here are the comparison results based on the current datasets:

| Dataset | Metric | Go Result | R Result | Notes |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Integers | Symmetric trimmed mean (5%) | 80.922222 | 80.92222 | Matches closely (minor rounding difference) |
| Integers | Asymmetric trimmed mean (low=5%, high=30%) | 45.923077 | 45.84058 | Slight difference due to R's quantile() using type 7 (standard R method) |
| Floats | Symmetric trimmed mean (5%) | 30.635437 | 30.63544 | Matches closely |
| Floats | Asymmetric trimmed mean (low=5%, high=20%) | 24.823254 | 24.82325 | Matches closely |

**Note:** R's `quantile()` function uses **type 7** by default (the standard R method), which can create very slight differences in asymmetric trimmed means compared to Go. This is normal and expected.

R provides a transparent verification method for Go outputs, ensuring consistency between implementations.

## AI Transparency

- The `main.go` program and the `trimmedmean_review` code were constructed with the assistance of **ChatGPT** and **DeepSeek** to ensure accurate implementation of trimmed mean calculations.  
- This note ensures AI usage transparency in the development of analytical code.

## Requirements

- **Go 1.25+**  
- **CSV datasets**: `int_sample.csv` and `float_sample.csv` in the same folder or update file paths accordingly.  
- **Optional**: R (for verification)

## Running the Go Program

1. Ensure Go is installed and the `go-trimmed-mean/trimmedmean` module is available locally or via GitHub.  
2. Open a terminal in the repository folder.  
3. Run:

```bash
go run main.go
